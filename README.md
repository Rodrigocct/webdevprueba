Breaking Bad API

**Set up the environment: utilise GitPod scripting to automatically pre-install Ionic and 
Angular CLI, install modules and plugins, generate the required pages and service(s).
**Set up the core app aspects: routing, tabs and introduce a Back-Navigation
functionality for all the required tab subpages (Characters and Episodes).
**Consume API data: use Observables, ngFor and ngIf logic provided by Angular.
**Improve the design: change the default Ionic UI, theming & CSS variables and
showcase the ability to use appropriate Ionic Icons for the tabs


for my project I used the app that we made in class and the materials in moodle to figure out how to do it.

I used this API link https://breakingbadapi.com to run my project.

I used this link to find the icons for my project https://ionic.io/ionicons
